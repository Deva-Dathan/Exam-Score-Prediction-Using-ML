The project file contains:
1 : Vendor Folder
2 : composer.json
3 : composer.lock
4 : mark.php
5 : p.py
6 : p2.py

The vendor folder contains the external machine learning libraries.
the composer.json and composer.lock contains the library name and its version
mark.php is the main php file of exam score predicting file
p.py and p2.py are the python working file. i usually do the machine learning code in python are later convert to php version, So the p.py contains the same functionality with 2 input that is exam 1 mark and exam 2 mark(pedefined marks)
same in the p2.py, instead of predicting the 3rd exam mark. in this 4 input will give 5th mark is predicted.....the number of input changes in both files
